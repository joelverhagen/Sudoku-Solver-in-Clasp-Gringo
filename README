This Sudoku solving program is written for Clasp / Gringo. 

I run it using the combined application, Clingo.

To download Clasp, Gringo, or Clingo, go to http://potassco.sourceforge.net/ .

To run the solver, run the following command:

clingo 0 puzzle_easy.lp sudoku.lp

This is a demonstration of how easy some problems can be to solve using the correct programming language.
